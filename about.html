            Hi there! I'm Sailesh, and I'm from Kotagiri, The Nilgiris.
             I'm a Job searcher, fresher, and a Data Science Enthusiast.
              I had completed my schooling in my native town Kotagiri, The Nilgiris.
               In 2016 and joined <a href="https://kahedu.edu.in/"target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">
                Karpagam Academy of Higher Education</a> for the UG course.
                I chose BE. Computer Science & Engineering, I graduated in 2020,
                 and I've been working on my domain and practicing my skills.
                  I trained myself in technical skills such as Python, Data Analytics,
                   Machine Learning, Deep Learning, HTML/CSS, and Cloud platforms.
                    I've also been Certified as Professional Data Scientist from 
                    IBM and Machine Learning from Stanford University through Coursera. <br><br>
                   <br><br>
                     Besides the technical skills, I play football, and I'm a good sprinter.
                      I like watching movies and series, more of a romantic and Si-Fi genre.
                       I also used to go out with my friends, chill sometimes and have a great time.
                        I spend a lot of time on social media,
                         particularly Instagram. Follow me on InstagramðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‰<a href="https://www.instagram.com/__sailesh_shocker__/" target="_blank"
